            🏆 The Journey of Victor Milamulo Lukumbu (2014–2025)
        </strong>
        <p>
          📍 2014 — The Beginning of Trust
          It all began in 2014, in the heart of Beni, where a young boy
           named Victor Milamulo Lukumbu took his first steps into organized 
           football. He joined Capaco Academy as a junior, not just with talent, 
           but with trust—trust in the process, in the coaches, and in himself.
         <img class="pic-aca" src="images/celebrating durba.jpg"  alt="">

          Victor wasn’t the loudest on the pitch, but his discipline and hunger to learn
           quickly caught the attention of his mentors. He trained relentlessly, absorbing 
           every drill, every tactic, and every lesson like a sponge. This was the foundation 
           year—the year that planted the seed of a future striker.
          </p>
          
          <p>>📍 2016 — The Leap to Senior Level
          Just two years later, Victor made his first official appearance with AC Capaco’s senior team. It was a proud moment, but also a humbling one. The leap from junior to senior was steep, and Victor spent most of the year on the bench—not as a punishment, but as a student of the game.
          
          <img src="images/victor on the bench.jpg" class="ac-bench" alt="on the bench">
          
          He watched, learned, and practiced. Every match was a classroom. Every substitution was a lesson in patience. And every senior teammate was a mentor. That year taught Victor that growth isn’t always loud—it’s often quiet, internal, and deeply transformative.
          </p>
          
          
          <p>📍 2017 — First Local Contest Appearance
          By 2017, Victor was ready. He had earned his place in the starting XI of AC Capaco during a local contest in Beni town. This was his first taste of competitive football beyond the academy walls.

          He played alongside seasoned players, holding his own and showing flashes of brilliance. The crowd began to recognize his name. Coaches began to trust his instincts. And Victor began to believe that he belonged—not just on the pitch, but in the spotlight.
          </p>
          
          <p>📍 2018 — Breakthrough as a Striker
          2018 was the year Victor exploded. Playing as a striker, he scored 12 goals in the local contest, finishing as the second top scorer. His style was direct, fearless, and clinical.

          </p>
          
          <p>📍 2019 — First Congo Cup Appearance 🇨🇩
          The following year, Victor played in his first Congo Cup with AC Capaco. It was a national-level competition, and for Victor, it felt like stepping into a dream.

          </p>
          
          <p>📍 2020 — Return to First Division
          After the Congo Cup, Victor returned to the local First Division contests. It was a recalibration year—less about glory, more about consistency.

          He used this time to refine his technique, build stamina, and mentor younger teammates. Victor wasn’t just growing as a player—he was evolving into a leader.
          </p>
          
          <p>📍 2021 — Provincial Competition with AC Capaco
          In 2021, Victor represented AC Capaco in the provincial competition. The stakes were higher, the crowds louder, and the matches tougher.

          Victor’s performance was steady and mature. He played with tactical awareness, often dropping deep to support midfield and pressing high when needed. His versatility began to shine.
          </p>
          
          <p>📍 2022 — Transfer to CS Vijana 4x4 (Bunia City)
          Victor’s journey took a new turn in 2022 when he transferred to CS Vijana 4x4 in Bunia City. It was a bold move—new city, new team, new expectations.

          But Victor adapted quickly. His presence brought energy to the squad, and his experience from Capaco gave him an edge. He became a key figure in the team’s attacking strategy.
          </p>
          
          
          <p>📍 2023 — Top Scorer in ERFTURI Competition
          2023 was Victor’s golden year in Bunia. He scored 15 goals in the ERFTURI competition, finishing as the top scorer.
          
          <img src="images/vijana fanny day.jpg" class="fun" alt="">
          
          His goals came in all forms—headers, volleys, solo runs. He was unstoppable. Fans in Bunia began calling him “The Finisher.” His reputation soared, and scouts started paying attention.
          </p>
          
          <p>📍 2024 — Transfer to FC MONT BLEU (Bunia City)
          Following his top scorer season, Victor transferred to FC MONT BLEU, one of Bunia’s most respected clubs.
          
          <img class="display-img" src="images/displaying the jersey durba.jpg" alt="">
          
          This move was strategic. Victor wanted to challenge himself further, play with elite teammates, and prepare for national-level competition. His ambition was clear: to rise to the top of Congolese football.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>📍 2025 — Joined CS ELDORADO (Second National League)
          And in 2025, Victor did just that. He joined CS ELDORADO, competing in Congo’s Second National League.
