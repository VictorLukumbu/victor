          <div class="about-text">
           
            <p> 
              It all began in 2014, in the heart of Beni, where a young boy
               named Victor Milamulo Lukumbu took his first steps into organized 
               football. He joined Capaco Academy as a junior, not just with talent, 
               but with trust—trust in the process, in the coaches, and in himself. <br>
            
              Victor wasn’t the loudest on the pitch, but his discipline and hunger to learn
               quickly caught the attention of his mentors. He trained relentlessly, absorbing 
               every drill, every tactic, and every lesson like a sponge. This was the foundation 
               year—the year that planted the seed of a future striker.</p>

            <p>VJust two years later, Victor made his first official appearance with AC Capaco’s senior team. 
              It was a proud moment, but also a humbling one. The leap from junior to senior was steep,
               and Victor spent most of the year on the bench—not as a punishment, but as a student of the game.

           This was his first taste of competitive football beyond the academy walls.
          He played alongside seasoned players, holding his own and showing flashes of brilliance. The crowd began
           to recognize his name. Coaches began to trust his instincts. And Victor began to believe that he belonged—not just on the pitch, but in the spotlight.
