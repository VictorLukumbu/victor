           <h3>📍 2014 — The Beginning of Trust</h3>
           <img src="images/in the academy.jpg" alt="Victor in 2014" class="about-img">
          <div class="about-text">
           
            <p> 
              Before the goals. Before the jerseys. Before the name echoed through Bunia and beyond—there was Beni, 2014. A city of red dust, resilience, and raw dreams. And in its heart, a boy named Victor Milamulo Lukumbu laced up his first pair of boots, unaware that he was stepping into a story that would one day inspire a generation.
              He was just a kid then. Quiet. Observant. The kind who didn’t speak much, but when he touched the ball, it spoke for him.
              That year, Victor joined Capaco Junior Academy, but his journey had already begun long before that. He had played for his school. He had played in his quarter. He had even worn the colors of Maniema Union from Beni Boikene, his first local club. The pitch was wherever space allowed—dusty streets, schoolyards, or open fields. The crowd? Whoever stopped to watch.
              “We didn’t have much,” Victor would later say. “But we had the ball. And that was enough.”
              
              At Capaco Junior, the environment was different. Structured. Demanding. Competitive. But Victor arrived with something rare: trust.
              <br>- Trust in the coaches who saw potential before proof. Especially the coach <strong>Justin Kanda and Djo Malick</strong>
              <br>- Trust in the drills that burned his legs but built his lungs.
              <br>- Trust in the process, even when the results didn’t come easy.
              <br>- And most of all, trust in himself.
              He started as a left winger—a position that demanded speed, vision, and courage. Victor had all three. He wasn’t the fastest. Not yet. He wasn’t the strongest. Not yet. But he was the most hungry.
              And hunger, when paired with humility, becomes a weapon.
              He trained relentlessly, absorbing every drill like a sponge. He studied the game with the eyes of a student and the heart of a believer. His teammates—Jospin (Pirlo) with his calm control, Gaga Yenga, Roger the defender, Juvenal, Justin, Kayembe, and many others—became his brothers. Together, they ran drills, shared dreams, and chased the ball through the chaos of a city that never promised safety.
              Because Beni, in 2014, was not just a football town. It was a war zone.
              In Boikene, where Victor lived, people often had to run—not for goals, but for their lives. Gunfire could interrupt a match. A training session could end in silence. And yet, Victor kept showing up. Even when the stadium was far, even when his family had little, even when fear hung in the air like smoke—he ran. He trained. He believed.
              “Football was my escape,” he said. “It gave me something the war couldn’t take—hope.”
              
              By the end of that year, Victor had earned more than minutes on the pitch—he had earned respect.  The coach <strong>Nzetu</strong> and other Coaches began to trust him with more responsibility. Older players such as <strong>Ley Sivirwa, Alain Mangapi, Olivier, Machozi Nguliko, and many more</strong> noticed his movement. And quietly, without fanfare, the academy began to shape its attack around him.
              2014 wasn’t the year Victor became a star.
              It was the year he became a student of the game.
              The year he learned to trust the grind.
              The year the seed was planted.
              And in the soil of struggle, that seed began to grow.

          <h3>📍 2015-2016 — The Leap to Senior Level</h3>
          <img src="images/victor on the bench.jpg" alt="Victor in 2016" class="about-img">
          <div class="about-text">
           
            <p>By 2016, the boy from Boikene had already carved his name into the heart of Capaco Junior. But football, like life, doesn’t wait. It demands growth. And that year, Victor Milamulo Lukumbu took the leap every young player dreams of—his first official appearance with AC Capaco’s senior team.
              It was a proud moment. A milestone. The kind that makes your family cry and your neighborhood erupt. But behind the celebration was a deeper truth: the jump from junior to senior was steep.
              Victor wasn’t handed a starting spot. He wasn’t the star. Not yet.
              He was the youngest in the locker room, surrounded by seasoned players with years of experience and muscle memory. The pace was faster. The tackles were harder. The expectations were heavier. And so, for most of that year, Victor sat on the bench—not as a punishment, but as a student of the game.
              “I learned more watching than I ever did playing,” Victor later said. “Every minute on the bench was a lesson.”
              
              Then came the moment.
              A match against AS Nyuki Football Club, in the electric atmosphere of Butembo City. The crowd was loud. The stakes were high. And when Gaga Yenga, Capaco’s starting striker, was subbed off, the coach turned to Victor.
              “You’re in. Play striker.”
              
              It was a shift. A transformation. Victor had always been a left winger—fast, wide, creative. But now, he was being asked to lead the line. To carry the weight. To become the point of the spear.
              He stepped onto the pitch with fire in his legs and thunder in his chest. The jersey felt heavier. The grass felt different. But the moment was his.
              He didn’t score that day. But he held the line, pressed with purpose, and showed flashes of a striker in the making. His muscle, movement, and mentality caught the eye of the coaching staff.
              “He didn’t try to impress,” said Coach Mavungu. “He tried to belong. And that’s what impressed us.”
              
              Back in Boikene, the news spread like wildfire. Friends from his quarter, old teammates from Maniema Union, and even his brother Prince were stunned. The quiet boy who once played barefoot in the dust was now facing AS Nyuki in Butembo.
              But it wasn’t all glory.
              After the match, Victor faced a wave of frustration. He was young. He felt the pressure. The weight of expectation. The silence of the bench. The noise in his head. For three days, he drifted—questioning, doubting, wondering if he truly belonged.
              And then something clicked.
              He looked back at the match. At the moment he stepped on the pitch. At the way the ball felt at his feet. And he realized:
              “This thing is good. I can do this. I belong here.”
              
              From that day forward, Victor stopped waiting for permission. He started believing. He trained harder. Thought sharper. Moved with purpose. And slowly, the winger became a striker. The student became a contender.
              2016 wasn’t the year Victor became a star.
              It was the year he became a professional.
              The year he changed positions.
              The year he faced doubt—and answered it with belief.

           This was his first taste of competitive football beyond the academy walls.
          He played alongside seasoned players, holding his own and showing flashes of brilliance. The crowd began
           to recognize his name. Coaches began to trust his instincts. And Victor began to believe that he belonged—not just on the pitch, but in the spotlight.

                and for Victor, it felt like stepping into a dream.
   
                The pressure was immense, but Victor thrived. He held his own against top-tier teams,
                 showcasing not just skill but composure. This tournament marked his arrival on the national

                  He used this time to refine his technique, build stamina, and mentor younger teammates. Victor wasn’t just growing as a player—he was evolving into a leader.

          In 2021, Victor represented AC Capaco in the provincial competition. The stakes were higher, the crowds louder, and the matches tougher.
           Victor’s performance was steady and mature. He played with tactical awareness, often dropping deep to support midfield and pressing high when needed. His versatility began to shine.

                <p>
                  In 2022, Victor Milamulo Lukumbu made a move that would redefine his footballing journey. Leaving behind the familiar rhythm of Capaco, he signed with CS Vijana 4x4, a rising force in Bunia City. For many, it was a surprising shift. For Victor, it was a leap of faith.
                 <strong style="text-decoration: underline;"> “I didn’t come to Bunia to blend in. I came to build something,” </strong> Victor later reflected.
                  
                  The transition wasn’t easy. New city. New teammates. New expectations. But Victor didn’t flinch. He arrived with quiet confidence and a hunger to prove himself—not just as a striker, but as a leader.
                  From the first training session, his impact was undeniable. His sharp movement off the ball, his ability to read the game, and his relentless pressing lifted the team’s tempo. Drawing from his experience at Capaco, he brought a level of professionalism that inspired younger players and earned the respect of the coaching staff.
                  By mid-season, Victor had become the heartbeat of CS Vijana’s attack—linking play, creating chances, and delivering goals when it mattered most. His presence on the pitch wasn’t just tactical; it was emotional. He played with purpose, with pride, and with the weight of a dream bigger than himself.
                  “Every time I wear this jersey, I think of the people back home. I play for them,” he said after a crucial win.
                  
                  Victor’s 2022 season wasn’t just about a transfer. It was about transformation. It was about stepping into the unknown and turning it into home. It was about proving that legacy isn’t inherited—it’s built, one match at a time.

His shorts bear the number 14, printed boldly on the left thigh—a number that may soon carry weight in Bunia’s football circles.

                    His stance is confident: hands on hips, cleats planted firmly, gaze locked onto the camera. The cleats—white with green and orange accents—add a flash of energy to his grounded presence. Behind him, another player in similar gear warms up, hinting at the team atmosphere and the start of integration.
                    
                    The field is an artificial turf, clean and vibrant, bordered by a concrete wall and scattered trees—an outdoor facility that feels both raw and full of promise. This isn’t just a training ground. It’s the stage for Victor’s next evolution.
